# Knotted

I have tried many habit tracking applications over the years, and none of them allow logged habits to count towards multiple goals.

For example, if you have two goals -- having a morning routine and getting in shape. Which one should "eat a healthy breakfast" count towards? Clearly not just one of them; our lives are a bit more entangled than that.

Knotted is a web application that solves this problem by supporting many-to-many relationships between goals and habits.
